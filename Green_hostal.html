			<p>Great facilities and comfy beds. Everything was good in my opinion.
			The rooftop was a great place to watch the sunset and Nice hostel. Very central location.
			We stayed in a 10 bed dorm and it was a little cramped though.
			I had to put my bag at the other end of the room because it would block the door otherwise.
			There was an air-con war in our room too as it gets hot at one end and stays cold at the
			other but that we sorted that among ourselves.
			Mattresses were quite thin too but the memory foam pillow was nice.
			Bathrooms were clean and common area and kitchen was nice. 
			Good value hostel in a great location!</p>

			<p>My stay was good overall. But one thing to mention,
			there was an unpleasant odor in my room and even though I left the window open all day,
			the odor was still there and Nothing wrong with the hostel, it was clean and the staff
			were friendly but there just really wasnâ€™t much of an atmosphere, 
			very quiet (which could be good depending on what you want). There just was not many people
			staying there and it was kind of lonely, this might be different depending on the time of year you stay of course.</P>

			<p>The hostel is perfectly located. Minutes walk to the busy areas and very close to a fantastic spot to grab some Ramen.
			The staff was super friendly and really helpful. Everything was clean and the bathrooms are nice.
			Not much of an atmosphere but it was still a great stay,AMAZING!! That is what this hostel is, amazing.
			Had a great time there, the female host during the day (i don't know her name) hihi, she was a breath of fresh air,
			she was so kind and friendly. Made me feel like home. I highly recommend this hostel. It was clean, i stayed 
			in the girls only section and it was perfect. Nice room,
			comfy bed with curtains. Good shower and separate toilet. We even had a balcony with a view. 
			The kitchen and lounge were amazing, and spacious. I loved it.</p>
